                    <h2>Hellonic</h2>
                    Capital: Hellonica - Planet: Arborea
                    <br>
                    <br>The whole race Hellonic suffered great oppression and prejudice for allying themselves with the Demon God Novaro. 
                    As a result, they have lost their trust of outsiders and decided to do things by themselves instead. 
                    Most Hellonics follow no gods anymore, although some have decided to follow Valky, Goddess of Freedom. 
                    The humans helped Valky to settle the Hellonic free from all suffering, but only after they were free from the demon's grasp.
                    <br>
                    <br>The Hellonic are originally a clan who fled the bloodthirsty Devan Empire, and their Goddess of Darkness, Zuras. 
                    Hellonics wandered the continent of Arun on the planet Arborea and founded the capital city Hellonica until Novaro took them under his patronage, 
                    as Hellonics were skilled artisans and to annoy his sister Zuras. Novaro created with the best Hellonic artisans an artifact known as the Crown of Remedy. 
                    The crown was meant cure Zuras and channel the collected power of the gods from her and store it somewhere – but it ended up killing her. 
                    This caused not only the arcane scars on the Hellonics bodies which persist to this day as sort of a Mark of Cain.
                    This also caused the Hellonics to abandon their home in Hellonica and make them flee to diffrent planets.

                    <br>
                    <br>Cursed by their god to wander without a homeland, humans turned their adversity to advantage by using their long exile as a learning experience. 
                    They studied the culture and crafts of other races, and forged their own destiny without guidance from their neglectful deity. 
                    Now, as creators of Project Valkyria, they are admired and respected by all the nations of the world for their role in bringing together 
                    the coalition that will defeat the Demon God Novaro and return the planet Arborea back to peace at last.
                    <br>
                    <br>Gavin, God of Wisdom, created the human race but turned his back on them when they petitioned him for a homeland. 
                    When the first humans conspired to steal Gavin's priceless treasures, he cursed them to wander forever. 
                    As the godly war drew to a close, the curse on the humans lifted. Valky, Goddess of Freedom, took pity on the humans and 
                    granted them the homeland they’d long been denied. Their capital today is the beautiful city Valkyria she created with them.

                    <h2>Wind Elve</h2>
                    Capital: Uamia - Planet: Yubarath
                    <br>
                    <br>Noble yet cunning, Elves are known for their arrogance and great knowledge. Elves were hostile and expanding though conquest. 
                    They were the pinnacle of civilization before the godly war. However, after the war's source of power, the Flower of Life, got destroyed, 
                    it causes massive destruction and many deaths. The Elves split to two factions, the Wind Elves and the Mighty Elves.
                    <br>
                    <br>The Elves once lived lives dedicated to venerating nature and the gods. The children of Alina, Goddess of Nature, maintained their forest 
                    homes in peace, but that changed when the conflicts of immortals destroyed their civilization and split a proud and powerful race into two factions. 
                    Now, only the Wind Elves remain. After hundred years of conquest, a force of allied races dealt the Mighty Elves armies a devastating loss. 
                    After this rebuke, the Elves withdrew from the world for a century of seclusion that only ended when the gates of Uamia opened to refugees fleeing 
                    the invasion of the Demon God Novaro. Valky, Goddess of Freedom, took notice when from those gates marched an army that fought for the lives of all mortal races. 
                    Though the blood of Elven soldiers bought their seat at the table of Project Valkyria, many other races do not trust the Elves new way, in believing the 
                    capital's walls conceal many secrets and that the Elves never gave up their conquering ways.

                    <br>
                    <br>Known for their feminine appearance, a Furry features unique tails and ears and an almost childlike demeanor 
                    even though they may be hundreds of years old. The Furry is not to be underestimated, as their knowledge greatly 
                    surpasses that of the average person. They united with the Wind Elves in order to stop and restore peace with anything harmful to nature.
                    <br>
                    <br>Building corporeal forms around tiny fragments of her own divine being, the Goddess Salia created the Furry. 
                    Their physical appearance reflected the youngest daughter of Salia, Princess Jury, naive desire for beauty and peace. 
                    The Goddess of the Nature governs both, the Furry and the Wind Elves, why they share a history and a mission. 
                    Alina and Jury, together with their forces, have proven their wisdom and diplomatic prowess in peace, and their tactical and fighting prowess in war.
